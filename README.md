# WHATWG Participant Data

This repository hosts the data submitted through the [WHATWG Participant Agreement](https://participate.whatwg.org/agreement).

## Maintenance

Whenever an individual or entitity signs the agreement, an entry is added to the respective JSON file with the `verified` field set to false. When they then make a contribution, the respective editor will [check everything is in order](https://github.com/whatwg/participate.whatwg.org#process-for-editors "Process for Editors") and set the `verified` field to true or escalate as appropriate. If they do not end up contributing their `verified` field likely is not changed.
